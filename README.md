# üß© Graph-Mind

**Graph-Mind** is a visual-first AI-powered knowledge graph built for Product Managers to intuitively map product strategy, concept evolution, and cross-functional intelligence. Designed to eliminate information silos, Graph-Mind connects the dots across roadmaps, documentation, teams, and data‚Äîturning fragmented inputs into a cohesive decision-making graph.
